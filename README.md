- [ ] Humen body can repair any problem by update or repain DNA using a backup DNA DataBase from cloud.
- [ ] Create a Energy field, protect the Earth (or body or country)
- [ ] a code and distroy any AI

4. A watch ⌚ has a sensor, can passively detected heartbeat. if there was any emergency situation, when patient cannot call anyone. this time this watch is automatically connecting emergency call via phone. [3 jan 2025]
